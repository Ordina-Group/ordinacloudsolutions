- Increase of market share
- Faster time to market of new features, products or services
- Increase IT flexibility to faster act on market changes 

Is your organisation looking for any of these reasons, or any that apply for you? In that case a cloud migration or adoption strategy can help you in reaching these goals.

Happy Customer X
> It's amazing. We had no idea what we were getting ourselves into with this cloud stuff. However, in only two workshops with Ordina, we had devised a strategy that would have moved all our IT infrastructure to the cloud in two years which aligns with our business goals.

## Cloud strategy
In order for your organisation to determine the cloud strategy that aligns with your business goals, a strategy will be defined in a value discovery project. During this phase, our experts will define the exact details of the current situation and the outcome. They will get in contact with the stakeholders and investigate a.o. the current IT infrastructure, organigram, budget and return of investment. Some deliverables of this value discovery can be:
- Cloud strategy defining vendors, public, private or on premise deployment
- Alignment of goals from all stakeholders
- Application portfolio
- Budget, cost and resource planning
- Migration plan
